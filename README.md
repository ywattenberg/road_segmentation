# Road Segmentation of aerial images using ResidualAttentionDuckNet
Inspired
by two recently published DCNN models, namely Residual
Attention UNet (ResAttUNet) and Deep Understanding
Convolutional Kernel UNet (DUCK-Net), we developed
a new architecture that combines the main building blocks
of these two models. We call this model RA-DUCKNet.
