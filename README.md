# Road Segmentation of aerial images using RA-DUCKNet
Inspired by two recently published DCNN models, namely Residual
Attention UNet (ResAttUNet) and Deep Understanding
Convolutional Kernel UNet (DUCK-Net), we developed
a new architecture that combines the main building blocks
of these two models. We call this model Residual
Attention DUCKNet (RA-DUCKNet).

Further, we created a new dataset containing some 65â€™000 satellite images with
a ground truth mask from urban areas in the United States.
